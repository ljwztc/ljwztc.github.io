I am currently a third year (2020-2024) Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/home/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Department of Electrical Engineering</font></a> of <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">City University of Hong Kong (CityU)</font></a>, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://hlli1991.github.io" target="_blank"><font color="brown"> Haoliang Li</font></a> and co-supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/people/academic-staff/professors/prof-yixuan-yuan" target="_blank"><font color="brown"> Yixuan Yuan</font></a>. 

<br />
Previously, I got my B.E. in Electronic Science and Technology from the <a href="http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/"><font color="brown">Zhejiang University(ZJU)</font></a> in 2020. I had great honor to work with Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xdQSx54AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Zhaoyang ZHANG</font></a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=l1UWN14AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Chunguang LI</font></a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tekfySwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Xiaojing GONG</font></a>. 

<br />
In this stage, my research aims to develop novel <b>machine learning</b> algorithms for <b>device-agnostic medical data processing and analysis</b>. My previous focus has been on addressing challenges related to <b>Distribution Shift</b>, <b>Open Set Learning</b>, and <b>Partial Label Learning</b> in order to create effective learning systems. Currently, I am also devoted to low-level vision enhancement in medical images.
